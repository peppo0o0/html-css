            On a cobweb afternoon
            In a room full of emptiness
            By a freeway I confess
            I was lost in the pages
            Of a book full of death
            Reading how we'll die alone
            And if we're good, we'll lay to rest
            Anywhere we want to go
            In your house, I long to be
            Room by room, patiently
            I'll wait for you there
            Like a stone
            I'll wait for you there
            Alone
            And on my deathbed I will pray
            To the gods and the angels
            Like a pagan to anyone
            Who will take me to heaven
            To a place I recall
            I was there so long ago
            The sky was bruised
            The wine was bled
            And there you led me on
            In your house, I long to be
            Room by room, patiently
            I'll wait for you there
            Like a stone
            I'll wait for you there
            Alone
            Alone
            And on I read
            Until the day was gone
            And I sat in regret
            Of all the things I've done
            For all that I've blessed
            And all that I've wronged
            In dreams until my death
            I will wander on
            In your house, I long to be
            Room by room, patiently
            I'll wait for you there
            Like a stone
            I'll wait for you there
            Alone
            Alone
